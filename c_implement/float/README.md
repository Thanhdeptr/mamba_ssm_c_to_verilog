# Float implementation
This folder contains the floating-point reference implementation of Mamba SSM layers.
Use it to validate numerical correctness against the fixed-point/HLS version.
Key files: `Layers_float.h/.cpp`, `Main_float.h/.cpp`.
Build locally with a C++17 compiler; no HLS dependencies required.
